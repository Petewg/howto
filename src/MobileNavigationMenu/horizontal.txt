Horizontal Mobile Navbar
This example demonstrates how a navigation menu on a mobile/smart
phone could look like.

Click on the Trigram For Heaven menu (three bars) in the top right corner,
to toggle the menu.

Note that this example should'nt be used if you have a lot of links,
as they will "break" the navbar when there's too many
(especially on very small screens).
